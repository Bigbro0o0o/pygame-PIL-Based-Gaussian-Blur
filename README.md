# pygame-PIL-Based-Gaussian-Blur
It converts a pygame surface to a PIL surface, blurs it, then turns it to a blured pygame surface.
I could not find a solution on the web so I took a while to put one together.
Maybe I wasnt googleing the right things but I couldnt find much documentation on this topic.
